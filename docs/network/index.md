# Network
---

Subble contains a network protocol specification that allow communication with external applications. For security reasons this functionality must be explicitly activated in order to accept connections.
It's possible to consult the [current specification](subble-socket/1.0.0/index.md), it is based on the TCP/IP protocol, so any language can implement it without great difficulties.

Right now there are no implementation of this protocol in other languages, but a Javascript implementation over websockets is planned.
